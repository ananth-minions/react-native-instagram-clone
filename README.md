## Run project locally

1. Add file `.env` into server folder with config

```
PORT=YOUR_PORT

```

2. Install all dependencies with `npm install` or `yarn` in root, client and instaclone-app folders

3. Configure your `prisma` account; in root directory put `prisma.yml`

```

4. Install globally `nodemon`, `prisma` and `expo-cli` packages

5. Run `yarn prisma`

7. Run `yarn serve:web` for web or `yarn serve:app` for mobile (you can also run `yarn serve` if you want to view all platforms)

8. If you want to upload images - you need to sign in `Amason Web Services` (I used free trial aws account and S3 bucket) and put your settings to `.env` like
